# UNET
My toy UNETpytorch code for training and Inference
## Network architecture
  - I used original U-Net paper for the basic architecture and slightly modified input size to remove cropping because my data does not touch boundary
  - see [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
## contenst
  - training jupyter notebook
  - inference jupyter notebook
  - training data 
    - I used Kaggle Carvana car segmentation data set for traning network
    - see [Kaggle carvana data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data)
  - sample data
    - I made datas/train and datas/train_mask sample folder and pu few image from Kaggle Carvana data set
